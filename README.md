# Stardew_SprinklerCalculator

## To Do List:
- Fix sprinkler algorithm because currently it bugs a little and not optimizing
- add map presets that put an X on the spots where the user can't build on already
- allow ability to change the type of sprinkler (quality and iridium)
- Allow the buildings to be the select square (has some transparency to it), if too difficult to do, can allow it to just be green select square, and then the building shows up after click
