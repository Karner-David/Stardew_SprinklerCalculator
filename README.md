# Stardew_SprinklerCalculator

## To Do List:
- Get Dimensions of actually map, length and width, unit: # of blocks
- Get Dimensions of the buildings, and implement a map from building - dimension that select can then use to change to
- Move Select/Delete Button to Top Right
- Fix the alignment of the select square, pretty sure it depends on the size of the select :()
- Allow the buildings to be the select square (has some transparency to it), if too difficult to do, can allow it to just be green select square, and then the building shows up after click
- Submit button needs to get better
